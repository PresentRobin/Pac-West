# Pac-West
Western Pac-Man Game



**Introduction** 

A team of second year IT students from NHL Stenden are requested to build a game based on the C# language for their C# programming class. The team is comprised of “Samuel Fremont”, “Precious Oziwo”, “Jeremi Haakmat” and “Robin Michael Visser. 

The name of the group is team Pac Western. Like the name of the group suggests, the team has decided to create a Pac-Man-esque game in which the fruit collectables are replaced with bullets. When the player encounters a ghost, instead of losing a life the player will enter a western showdown mini game with the ghost. The player will have to shoot the ghost within a certain amount of time, different ghosts have various times. 

Each mini-game costs a bullet, and if the player does not have a bullet by the time a ghost is encountered, it automatically counts as a loss for the player.
